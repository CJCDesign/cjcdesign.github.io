			<p>I work in alot of different mediums. Perhaps unfocused, perhaps easily bored, perhaps they will all combine someday. We'll see.</p>
			<p>I work as a graphic artist at The Globe and Mail. I ran a photography business for a decade, while also functioning as the assistant photo-editor at The Financial Post. My blog reflects my life in the country outside Toronto while the jewelry, drawings and graphics I create fill a tiny space in an otherwise cluttered visual world.</p>
